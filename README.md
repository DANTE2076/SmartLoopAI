# SmartLoopAI

## Blockchain name: SmartLoopAI

### Description

SmartLoopAI is an innovative blockchain platform designed to revolutionize the way people pay for services across industries. Based on the proven and secure X11 algorithm, SmartLoopAI offers high security and optimized performance, enabling fast and secure transactions.

### Technology

SmartLoopAI utilizes the X11 hashing algorithm, which consists of 11 different cryptographic algorithms, providing an additional layer of security over traditional algorithms. This layered hashing system increases the network's resilience to attacks and makes mining more accessible by distributing computing resources more evenly.

### Currency

The blockchain's internal currency, SmartLoopAI (SMLP), serves as a universal means of payment for services on the network. SMLP can be used to pay for services in consulting, IT, education, freelancing, and many others. SMLP coins are designed to provide ease of transactions and lower transaction costs for service providers and their customers.
